# Operations

## Run

```bash
python wipboard.py            # straight from source, no install
uv tool install .             # install the console script locally
wipboard                      # then this works anywhere
```

## Verify

```bash
python -m pytest              # 12 tests, the whole suite
```

**pytest is required.** `python test_wipboard.py` runs nothing and exits 0, because the tests
take pytest fixtures and the file has no `__main__` block. This file claimed otherwise until
2026-10-21, which is worse than saying nothing: it hands you a green exit code from a command
that tested none of the code.

The suite builds throwaway git repos in a temp directory and commits to them, so it needs
`git` on PATH and a committer identity. CI sets one; locally your global `user.name` and
`user.email` cover it. If a test fails with "Author identity unknown", that is the cause.

## Release

PyPI, when the tool is ready to publish:

```bash
uv build
uv publish                    # needs a PyPI token in UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN
```

Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml` first. Tag the commit to match.

## Make the board unavoidable

The tool only fixes forgetting if you see the board without deciding to. Two ways:

**Shell profile.** PowerShell (`$PROFILE`):

```powershell
function projects { wipboard }
```

Bash or zsh:

```bash
alias projects=wipboard
```

**Claude Code SessionStart hook.** Prints the board every time a session opens, in any
project. In `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      { "matcher": "startup", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "wipboard" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

This hook belongs in your own settings, not in this repo. A tool that edits a stranger's
Claude config on install would be a bad citizen.

## The dashboard Worker

Optional. `worker/` holds a Cloudflare Worker that stores one pushed board in KV and serves it
as a web page. The CLI does not need it and sends nothing anywhere until `endpoint` is set.

### Verify the Worker

```bash
npm --prefix worker test
```

17 tests, run in the real Workers runtime via `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, not a mock.

### First deploy

**These steps have not been run end to end yet.** Correct them the first time you do.

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

The KV namespace already exists and its id is in `worker/wrangler.jsonc`. Recreate it only for
a fresh account:

```bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create BOARD
```

Generate a token and set it as a secret. Use a real random value, not a memorable one: it is
the only thing standing between the internet and your board.

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
npx wrangler secret put BOARD_TOKEN --config worker/wrangler.jsonc
npx wrangler deploy --config worker/wrangler.jsonc
```

Deploy creates the DNS record for `wipboard.enamelvault.com` and prints it.

### Lock it down BEFORE pushing a real board

Your board is a complete list of your projects with candid notes on each, so access control
comes **before** the first `wipboard push`, not after. The empty page is harmless; the
populated one is not.

**Cloudflare Access cannot protect a `*.workers.dev` hostname.** Access applications are
defined against hostnames in a zone on your account, and `workers.dev` belongs to Cloudflare.
This is why `wrangler.jsonc` deploys to `wipboard.enamelvault.com` and sets
`workers_dev: false`. Leaving `workers_dev: true` would keep an unauthenticated copy of the
board answering at `wipboard.aayus-pok.workers.dev`, straight around the policy you are about
to write.

In the Zero Trust dashboard, <https://one.dash.cloudflare.com>:

1. **Access, Applications, Add an application, Self-hosted.**
2. Name `wipboard`. Session duration is how often your phone re-authenticates; a month is
   reasonable for a board only you read.
3. Public hostname: subdomain `wipboard`, domain `enamelvault.com`, path empty.
4. Policy: name it, Action **Allow**, Include **Emails**, your address. Save.
5. **Add a second application** for the same hostname with path `api/board`, and give it one
   policy with Action **Bypass** and Include **Everyone**.

Step 5 is not optional and is the easiest thing to get wrong. Access authenticates humans
through an email round trip, which a scheduled task cannot complete, so an application
covering the whole hostname locks out your own pusher. Access matches the most specific path
first, so the `api/board` application wins there. That path is protected by the bearer token
instead, compared in constant time in `worker/src/index.ts`.

Confirm both halves before trusting it:

```bash
curl -sI https://wipboard.enamelvault.com/ | head -1
```

That should be a redirect to a login, not a 200. And `wipboard push` must still succeed.

### Point the CLI at it

`~/.config/wipboard/config.json`:

```json
{
  "endpoint": "https://wipboard.enamelvault.com/api/board",
  "token": "the same value you gave wrangler secret put"
}
```

`WIPBOARD_ENDPOINT` and `WIPBOARD_TOKEN` override the file, which is how a scheduled task
passes them without one. Then:

```bash
wipboard push
```

### Keep it fresh

The page is only as current as the last push, so push on events rather than hoping.

**On every commit, in any repo.** Append to the user-global hook at
`~/.config/git/hooks/post-commit` (the one `core.hooksPath` already points at):

```bash
wipboard push >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

Backgrounded and silenced on purpose: a commit must never wait on, or fail because of, the
network.

**After a stage change.** `wipboard set ...; wipboard push`.

**Every 15 minutes**, to catch dirty trees and elapsed time, via Task Scheduler:

```powershell
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute 'wipboard' -Argument 'push'
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Once -At (Get-Date) `
  -RepetitionInterval (New-TimeSpan -Minutes 15)
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'wipboard push' -Action $action -Trigger $trigger
```

None of this is installed for you. A tool that edits a stranger's git hooks or schedules tasks
on install would be a bad citizen, which is the same reason the `SessionStart` hook lives in
your Claude settings and not in this repo.

### The two auth modes

`AUTH_MODE` decides who guards the board, and the Worker refuses to serve it until one of
them is configured.

| Mode | Who authenticates | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` (default) | The Worker, via a `VIEW_TOKEN` cookie | nothing but a secret |
| `access` | Cloudflare Access, upstream | a domain in a zone you own |

Only the exact string `access` turns the Worker's own check off. A typo, a stripped var or a
missing one all mean token mode, so a misconfiguration locks the board rather than publishing
it. In token mode with no `VIEW_TOKEN` set, `GET /` returns 503 naming the fix.

For token mode, set the secret and visit the login URL once per device:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put VIEW_TOKEN
```

Then open `https://<your-worker>/login?k=<token>`. It sets an HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax
cookie good for a year and redirects to `/`, so the token does not sit in the address bar. It
is still in browser history: that is a known limitation, not an oversight.

Token mode has no sessions, no per-device revocation and no MFA, and rotating `VIEW_TOKEN`
signs out every device at once. It exists so the Worker is useful to someone without a domain.
If you have a domain, `access` is strictly better.

### Rotating BOARD_TOKEN

The naive order leaves a window where every push fails. There is no two-token support in the
Worker, so keep the window short and do it in this order:

1. `npx wrangler secret put BOARD_TOKEN --config worker/wrangler.jsonc` with the new value.
2. Immediately update `token` in `~/.config/wipboard/config.json`.
3. `wipboard push` to confirm.

Pushes between 1 and 2 return 401 and exit 2. Nothing is lost: the next push sends the whole
board, since every push is a full snapshot rather than a delta.

## Environment traps

- **Not every folder is a repo.** Three of the eighteen folders this was built against have
  no `.git`. Every git call has to degrade to "no git" rather than raising, and the test
  suite covers that case specifically.
- **`git` must be on PATH.** There is no bundled fallback. If it is missing, every project
  reads as "no git" and the board is useless but does not crash.
- **Windows paths in the store are JSON strings**, so backslashes are escaped. Read them back
  through `pathlib` rather than string-splitting.
- **The store is rewritten whole on every write.** It is a few kilobytes, so this is fine, but
  it means two concurrent `set` commands can lose one of the two. Not worth locking for a
  single-user tool; worth knowing if that ever stops being true.
- **`stage_set_at` is the hinge of the `!` flag.** If a write path ever forgets to update it,
  the flag silently stops firing and the tool quietly becomes a worse `ls`. The test for this
  is the most important one in the suite.
- **The local test runtime caps the compatibility date.** `wrangler.jsonc` sets
  `compatibility_date` to the date the Worker was created, but the installed `workerd` only
  supports up to its own build date and prints `Falling back to "2025-10-11"` on every test
  run. That warning is local only; the deployed Worker honours the configured date. Do not
  "fix" it by lowering the date.
- **`wrangler types` only sees bindings declared in `wrangler.jsonc`.** Secrets are not
  declared there, so `BOARD_TOKEN` reaches the generated `Env` only because it is listed in
  `worker/.dev.vars`, which is gitignored. On a fresh clone, `npm --prefix worker test` fails
  to type-check until you create that file. Its value is a local dev token and has nothing to
  do with the real secret.
- **npm blocks postinstall scripts by default here.** A fresh `npm install` in `worker/`
  leaves `workerd` and `esbuild` without their binaries, and every test fails confusingly.
  Run `npm install-scripts approve workerd esbuild` once, then install again.
- **Cloudflare bans `Python-urllib` by signature.** A push with urllib's default User-Agent
  comes back `403` with `error code: 1010` from the edge, before the Worker sees the bearer
  token, so it reads as an auth failure when it is nothing of the kind. `wipboard.py` sets a
  descriptive `USER_AGENT` for exactly this reason; a test pins it.
- **Do not pipe a secret into `wrangler secret put` from PowerShell.** The pipeline appends a
  line ending and the stored value stops matching what you wrote down, which surfaces as a
  `401` on every push with no hint why. Either type it at the prompt, or use
  `wrangler secret bulk <file.json>` with a file written as UTF-8 **without a BOM**.
- **PowerShell's `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` writes a BOM.** `config.json` written that way
  used to read as absent, so the CLI reported "Missing endpoint, token" about a file that
  contained both. The config loader now reads `utf-8-sig` and reports an unreadable file
  instead of silently treating it as missing, but prefer
  `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($p, $json, (New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding $false))`.
- **`uv tool install` copies the module, it does not link it.** After changing `wipboard.py`,
  run `uv tool install . --force` or the installed `wipboard` keeps running the old code. A
  new subcommand appearing as "invalid choice" is this, every time.
